	$ as a symbol evaluates to the address immediately following the current instruction
	$<label> evaluates to (label address) - (current instruction end address)
	
	e.g. MOV A, [IP + $symbol] will use IP-relative addressing to access the symbol
	
	@ as a symbol evaluates to the address immediately following the last instruction
	@<label> evaluates to (label address) - (previous instruction end address)
	
	e.g. 
	JMP byte [IP + I]
jumptable:
	db @dest_0
	db @dest_1
	db @dest_2
	
	@ when used in an instruction will always point to its opcode.
	@ when used in a directive will point to the $ of the most recent instruction
